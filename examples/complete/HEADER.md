# Complete example

The full surface of the module on one public load balancer: two frontends (a zone-redundant
public ip for inbound and a public ip prefix dedicated to SNAT), Tcp and Http probes, Https and
Udp rules (with disable_outbound_snat defaulted on by the module because outbound rules exist), an
explicit outbound rule with tuned port allocation, single-port and port-range NAT rules, and a
legacy NAT pool. The environment comes from the Terraform workspace (`terraform.workspace`), not a
variable. Run it with `just e2e complete`, which applies the stack then always destroys it.
